# Applied Mathematics Project

## Overview

This project is part of my **Applied Mathematics** course at **Plovdiv University**. It involves the implementation of various mathematical exercises using **Python** as an alternative to traditional software like Wolfram Mathematica. The goal is to apply mathematical concepts through programming and develop practical skills.

## Project Highlights

- **Numerical Methods**: Implementing algorithms for solving equations and optimization problems.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Utilizing Python libraries for effective data analysis and visualization.
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Creating models to simulate real-world scenarios and derive meaningful insights.
- **Problem-Solving**: Developing solutions to complex mathematical problems through programming techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for implementing exercises.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and handling arrays.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and plotting graphs.
